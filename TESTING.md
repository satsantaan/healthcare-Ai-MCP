## 🚀 Automated Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest jsdom

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- [ ] Components: 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Utilities: 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Critical paths: 100% coverage

## 🔧 Manual Testing Procedures

### 1. Fresh Installation Test

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd emr-ai-enhancement-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

npm run dev

# Verify application loads at http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Build and Preview Test

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Verify application works at http://localhost:4173
```

### 3. Environment Variable Test

```bash
# Test with Tempo disabled
VITE_TEMPO=false npm run build
npm run preview

# Verify no Tempo-specific features appear
```

### 4. Docker Test

```bash
